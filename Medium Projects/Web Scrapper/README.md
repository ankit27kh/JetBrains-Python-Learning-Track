This is the next project I finished. Painful.

Objectives:
1. The code takes two parameters from the user input: the number of pages (an integer) and the type of articles (a string). The integer with the number of pages specifies the number of pages on which the program should look for the articles.

2. Go to the https://www.nature.com/nature/articles website and find out how to navigate between the pages with the requests module changing the URL.

3. Create a directory named Page_N (where N is the page number) for each page in the desired category, and put all the articles that are found on the page with the matched type to this directory.

4. Save the articles to separate *.txt files. Process the titles for the filenames by removing punctuation and replacing ' ' with '_'. You can give users some feedback on completion, but it is not required.
