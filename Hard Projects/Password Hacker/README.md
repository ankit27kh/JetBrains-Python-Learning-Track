This is the fourth project I completed from the 'Hard' section.

Objective was to get the login credentials from the server.

* Stage 1 was just to connect.
* Stage 2 was to use brute force to find a password.
* Stage 3 was to try all possible combinations of a password from a list of passwords.
* Stage 4 added a login id. First find the ID with the same process as stage 3 and next the password using exception to find one character of the password at a time.
* Stage 5 removed the exception but added a time delay which could be exploited in the same way

The code is for the last stage.
