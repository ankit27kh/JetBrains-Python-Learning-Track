This is the next project I completed on the track.

Objectives:

1. Read an XML-file containing stories and headlines.

2. Extract the headers and the text.

3. Tokenize each text.

4. Lemmatize each word in the story.

5. Get rid of punctuation, stopwords, and non-nouns with the help of NLTK.

6. Count the TF-IDF metric for each word in all stories (which now only consists of nouns). 

7. Pick the five best scoring words. If there is a clash, words must be sorted in descending order alphabetically.

8. Print each story's headline and the five most frequent words in descending order. Display the titles and keywords in the same order they are presented in the file.
