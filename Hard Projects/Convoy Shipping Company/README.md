This is the 30th project which I completed on this track!

Objectives:

1. Prompt the user to give a name for the input file (complete with the .xlsx, .csv, [CHECKED].csv or .s3db extension). For the prompt message, use "Input file" name followed by a newline.

2. If your file is .xlsx or .csv, or it ends with %...%[CHECKED].csv, convert xlsx to csv and clean its records accordingly.

3. Add the score column to .s3db files. Populate the column with the scoring points, according to the algorithm described in the project. The score column should be added during the conversion from %...%[CHECKED].csv to .s3db.

4. Generate JSON and XML files according to the scoring points. All entries with a score of greater than 3 should be exported to the JSON file, others to the XML file.

5. The score column should not be exported to JSON and XML files.

6. Count the number of entries imported to JSON and XML files.

7. Display outputs of all changes that have been made.
